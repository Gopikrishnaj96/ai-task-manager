# AI Task Manager

A real-time AI-powered task management system that lets you create, manage, and track tasks with secure JWT authentication and a modern, responsive interface.

## Overview

This project consists of two parts:

- **Backend**: A RESTful API built with Golang and Fiber, connected to PostgreSQL. It handles user authentication (signup/login with JWT), task creation, and task retrieval.
- **Frontend**: A Next.js app styled with Tailwind CSS that provides a user interface for signing up, logging in, and managing tasks in real time.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure signup and login using JWT.
- **Task Management**: Create, view, and manage tasks.
- **Modern UI**: Responsive interface built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built using a modular approach with a separate backend and frontend.
- **Potential AI Integration**: Designed to support AI-powered task suggestions (e.g., using OpenAI API) as an enhancement.
- **Deployment Ready**: Can be deployed on cloud platforms such as Vercel (frontend) and Render/Fly.io (backend).
